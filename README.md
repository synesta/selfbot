## How to get started

- download <a href=https://node.js.org>node.js 
- download the selfbot as zip
- extract the files to your desktop
- when you are there open terminal in your IDE or just open it from searchbar in the bot's folder (ex. https://streamable.com/b4hl0y)
- write 'npm i', this will install all node packages 
- go to config.json and add your token, prefix and your footer.
- most commands will be locked to userID, scroll through selfbot.js for userID checks and replace them with your ID.
-- to get userID, go to settings and follow this (https://locus.is-a-cu.lt/2f636ac.png) then right click on your profile and click copy id (https://locus.is-a-cu.lt/0ddfb10.png)
